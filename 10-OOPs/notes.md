# Class in javascript
from ES6 it is introduced but JavaScript is primarily a prototype-based language,and class in js is syntactical sugar over existing prototype- based inheritance mechanism.
It just provide a more familier syntax for developer coming from java and c++

## OOP 
it is just a programming paradigm(style of writing programm)

## Object
-collection of multiple properties and methods

## why use OOP
to use full of js in readable fashion like class and its object and inheritance

## parts of OOP
Object literal 

-Constructor function (new keyword)
- Prototype - in any given data type prototype is its functionality which includes all properties and methods. Every data type prototype is inherited from Object as everything is Object in js 

- Classes
- Instance(new,this)

## 4 pillars
Abstraction
Encaptulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism
